# Go Key-Value Store

A simple in-memory key-value store with a persistent JSON backend, built to master Go's error handling patterns from the ground up.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project is not just about building a key-value store; it's a practical learning exercise. The primary objective is to provide a concrete application for implementing and understanding Go's error handling philosophy. We will progress from basic error checks to modern error wrapping, custom error types, and advanced debugging with stack traces.

## 🚀 Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Go (version 1.13 or later) installed.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-kvstore.git
    cd go-kvstore
    ```
3.  **Initialize the module:**
    ```bash
    go mod init kvstore
    ```
4.  **Create the initial files:**
    ```bash
    touch main.go store.json
    ```
